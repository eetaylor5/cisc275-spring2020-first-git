1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	An ArrayList of dogs is created. Then, 3 new dogs are created within the add 
method for the ArrayList. Lastly, A new Comparator for the Animal class was created in 
the sort method.

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the
Comparator?
	The Comparator constructor was called within the call to the sort method from 
Collections. The class definition for Comparator, which includes the necessary compare 
method, immediately follows the call to the Comparator constructor.
